We're at Future Fest, in Lahore, Pakistan, to meet digital creators who want to shape the future of production.

We'll also be demoing our *WhatsApp Bot*, which showcases our capabilities to consumers.


### Why We're Going
Our mission at Omni goes beyond just providing AI-powered solutions; we aim to revolutionize the way content is created, shared, and experienced globally. The tech conference serves as a dynamic platform where ideas converge, innovations flourish, and collaborations spark. It aligns perfectly with our commitment to staying at the forefront of technology and contributing to the evolution of AI in the media production landscape. We feel the best way to truly showcase our technology's power, and get real feedback, is through live demonstrations and one-to-one conversations.

### Who We Want to Meet

- Industry Leaders: We seek to engage with industry leaders who have a profound impact on the future of tech and media. Collaborating with these visionaries will not only elevate our understanding but also open avenues for strategic partnerships.
- Content Creators and Studios: Connecting with content creators, dubbing studios, and production houses is at the core of our agenda. We want to understand their challenges, share our vision, and explore how Omni can seamlessly integrate into their workflows.
- Tech Enthusiasts: Engaging with tech enthusiasts allows us to tap into a community of early adopters and innovators. Their insights and feedback will be invaluable as we iterate and enhance Omni's capabilities.

### What We Aim to Achieve

- *Commercial Dubbing Projects:* Early adopters who are keen to put Omni to a hard test, by contracting Omni for AI dubbing projects.
- *More relevant testing:* for industry leaders and tech influencers. These partnerships will not only amplify Omni's reach but also contribute to the development of AI-powered content creation on a global scale.
- *User Insights and Feedback:* We want people to use OmniDub more, and for creative use cases! We're on the lookout for content creators and independent users.
- *Showcasing Innovation:* We want to showcase Omni's innovative solutions to a diverse, techie audience. If you like what we do, tag us. If you don't, tell us. We'd love to learn how to improve.
- *Building a Community:* The conference is an opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals who share our passion. We aim to build a community of collaborators, learners, and contributors who can collectively shape the trajectory of AI in media production.

See you at the conference!
