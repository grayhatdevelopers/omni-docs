# AI on the big screen

We originally founded Omni to accelerate media production to consumer devices, and one day, even the big screen. 

After trying out our [consumer level technology](/guide), you may be interested in more large-scale use cases.

Some examples are:

- You're a content creator who wants to reach a larger audience
- You're a dubbing studio who wants to accelerate some of their processes with AI
- You're a newsroom, production company, or media outlet who wants to stand out from the competition, and use the latest tech to be faster in reaching the world.

Not fitting into any of the categories above? We want to hear from you too!

## Why Omni?

1. **Cost-Effectiveness:** Traditional dubbing is notorious for being expensive. Omni provides a budget-friendly solution without compromising on quality, ensuring you get more bang for your buck.

2. **Rapid Turnaround:** Omni's AI-powered technology accelerates the dubbing process, enabling you to meet tight deadlines and release content faster than ever.

3. **Adaptability:** Whether you're handling extensive content or require real-time solutions, we have models for almost all your specific needs, offering flexibility unmatched by traditional methods.

### When NOT to Use Omni

While Omni excels in various scenarios, there are instances where it might not be the ideal choice:

1. **Highly Artistic Content:** For projects demanding a nuanced and highly artistic touch, where human creativity is irreplaceable, traditional dubbing may still be the preferred choice.

2. **Extremely Specialized Requirements:** In cases where projects have highly specialized linguistic or cultural nuances that require human expertise, traditional dubbing might be more suitable.

3. **Small-Scale Productions:** For projects with minimal dubbing requirements or a focus on personalized, handcrafted content, traditional methods may provide a more tailored approach.

We value transparency and believe in helping you make informed decisions based on your unique project needs.
