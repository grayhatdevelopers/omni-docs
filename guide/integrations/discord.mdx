## Omni Discord Bot: User Guide

With OmniDub, you can seamlessly translate your audio files into any language you desire. Follow the straightforward steps below to start dubbing your audio files on Discord.

### Use the Slash Command
Use the `/dub` Slash Command in the text channel where the bot is present.

### Upload an Audio File
Click on the file upload icon and choose the audio file you want to dub.

### Choose a Language
After uploading the audio file, specify the language you want for the resultant audio by writing the language's name, or choosing from the list.

### Press Enter to Run the Command
Once you've uploaded the file and selected the language, press Enter to execute the `/dub` command.

### "Thinking..."
The bot will display "Thinking..." as it processes and converts your audio file.

### File Display
After a few seconds, the bot will showcase the dubbing result, providing you with the dubbed audio file.

> Note: OmniDub will notify you when the translation is ready for playback.

The Discord bot may respond with an error message, or become infinitely stuck. If this happens, please try the `/dub` command again after a while. If the issue persists, contact our support on [Discord](https://discord.gg/8a3A2EcrEC).
